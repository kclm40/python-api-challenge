* 3 Trends

* There is a strong correlation within the Northern Hemisphere that indicates the higher the latitude the lower the temperature.  We see a similiar correlation within the Southern Hemisphere, where the lower the latitude the lower the temperature.

* Within the Southern Hemisphere there is no correlation between cloudiness and latitude indicating that cloudiness is not impacted by latitude.

* The Southern Hemisphere has a stronger correlation with wind speed and latitude vs. the Northern Hemisphere.  In the Southern Hemisphere, the lower the latitude, the wind speeds tend to be slightly higher, due to outliers in the data.
